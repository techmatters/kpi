        First, it loops through all children of the root element.

        When all children are processed, it checks whether the node should be
        removed or not.

        The most nested children are processed first in order to know which
        parents must be kept.

        For example:
        With `nodes_to_keep = ['question_2', 'question_3']` and this XML:
        <root>
          <group>
              <question_1>Value1</question_1>
              <question_2>Value2</question_2>
          </group>
          <question_3>Value3</question_3>
        </root>

         Nodes are processed in this order:
         - `<question_1>`: Removed because not in `nodes_to_keep`

         - `<question_2>`: Kept. Parent node `<group>` is tagged `do_not_delete`

                      it is tagged `do_not_delete` by its child `<question_2>`

         - `<question_3>`: Kept.

        Results:
        <root>
          <group>
              <question_2>Value2</question1>
